     <p class="paragraph">Gig workers are individuals who undertake short-term, flexible, or task-based work outside traditional employer-employee relationships. They earn per task or project, often without fixed salaries or long-term contracts.</p>

    <h2>Types:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Platform-Based Gig Workers:</strong> Work via digital platforms like Uber, Zomato, Swiggy, Ola, Urban Company, or freelance sites (e.g., Upwork). Examples: ride-hailing drivers, delivery executives, freelancers in IT/design.</li>
      <li><strong>Non-Platform Gig Workers:</strong> Engage in informal, temporary work like construction, event staffing, or seasonal labor, not reliant on digital platforms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scale:</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Per NITI Aayog (2022), India had ~7.7 million gig workers in 2020-21, projected to reach 23.5 million by 2029-30 (6.7% of non-agricultural workforce). The gig economy contributes ~1.25% to India’s GDP, with a projected value of $455 billion by 2024.</p>

    <h3>Demographics:</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Predominantly young (70% under 40), urban-based, with men dominating mobility/delivery and women in beauty/caregiving roles. Rural migrants often take up non-platform gig work.</p>

    <h2>Why Are Laws Needed for Gig Workers?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of Social Security:</strong> No access to insurance, pensions, or paid leave; high personal costs and low net earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Job Insecurity:</strong> No contracts or protection; fluctuating income based on demand.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithmic Exploitation:</strong> Platform control via opaque algorithms; unfair penalties.</li>
      <li><strong>Health and Safety Risks:</strong> Frequent injuries without compensation or insurance.</li>
      <li><strong>Economic Contribution:</strong> Drives e-commerce and mobility; needs legal protection.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Equity:</strong> Laws help reduce inequality and protect marginalized communities.</li>
    </ul>

     <h2>Accessing Official Documentation</h3>

    <h2>How to Engage</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>File RTI to access scheme records.</li>

Recent laws like the Code on Social Security and Rajasthan’s Welfare Act attempt to provide protection, but enforcement and inclusion remain key challenges. Continued monitoring, digital access, and RTI use are crucial for equitable reform.</p>
