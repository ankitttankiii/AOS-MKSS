       <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p class="paragraph">
      The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), enacted in 2005, is a flagship Indian legislation aimed at providing livelihood security to rural households by guaranteeing at least 100 days of wage employment per financial year for unskilled manual work. It is one of the world’s largest social welfare programs, designed to reduce rural poverty, curb migration to urban areas, and create durable community assets like roads, canals, and water conservation structures.
    </p>

    <div class="rti-section">
      <h3>Key Features of MGNREGA:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Any adult (18+) residing in rural areas can apply for work, with a focus on unskilled manual labor. Households register with local Gram Panchayats to receive a job card.</li>
        <li><strong>Work Guarantee:</strong> Work must be provided within 15 days of application, or applicants are entitled to an unemployment allowance.</li>
        <li><strong>Wages:</strong> Paid as per state-specific minimum wage rates, with equal pay for men and women. Payments are made directly to bank accounts to reduce corruption.</li>
        <li><strong>Types of Work:</strong> Projects include water conservation, irrigation, road construction, afforestation, and land development, prioritizing local needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Integrated with RTI Act, citizens can access records like muster rolls and expenditure details. Social audits ensure transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>Funding:</strong> Jointly funded by central and state governments. The center covers wages and part of material costs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Objectives:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a social safety net for rural poor.</li>
        <li>Empower marginalized groups, including women and Scheduled Castes/Tribes.</li>
        <li>Strengthen rural infrastructure and natural resource management.</li>
        <li>Promote inclusive growth and reduce rural-urban migration.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Impact:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reach:</strong> Over 11 crore households employed annually, with over 50% participation by women.</li>
        <li><strong>Assets Created:</strong> Millions of projects like check dams, rural roads, and ponds.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment:</strong> RTI has exposed mismanagement and ensured better fund delivery. Social media posts highlight MGNREGA’s labor-intensive design as inclusive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Delayed payments due to bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>Corruption and fund leakage despite audits.</li>
        <li>Some projects lack durability or proper execution.</li>
        <li>Demand often exceeds the 100-day limit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RTI and MGNREGA:</h3>
      <p>
        The RTI Act enhances MGNREGA’s effectiveness by allowing citizens to request details on job card registrations, wage payments, and project expenditures. This transparency has uncovered ghost workers and fund misappropriation, leading to better accountability and stronger implementation.

      <!-- Implementation Process -->
    <div class="rti-section">
      <h3>Implementation Process:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Job Card Issuance:</strong> Rural households register with their Gram Panchayat, receiving a job card with household details and a unique ID. This card tracks work and wages.</li>
        <li><strong>Work Allocation:</strong> Local bodies (Gram Panchayats) plan projects based on community needs, approved by district authorities. Work sites are within 5 km of applicants’ residences.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> MGNREGA uses digital tools like the NREGAsoft platform to track job cards, attendance, and payments. Social audits, mandated annually, involve community verification of records.</li>
        <li><strong>Gender Inclusion:</strong> Over 50% of workers are women, with provisions like crèches at work sites to support female participation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Recent Developments (as of July 2025):</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Budget Allocation:</strong> The 2024-25 Union Budget allocated ₹86,000 crore for MGNREGA, with demands for increases due to rising rural distress. Recent X posts suggest debates on expanding the work guarantee to 150 days in drought-hit areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Technology Integration:</strong> Aadhaar-linked payments have reduced leakages but caused issues for workers without proper documentation. The government is piloting GPS-based attendance in some states.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Focus:</strong> Projects increasingly prioritize climate resilience, like watershed management and afforestation, aligning with India’s sustainability goals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Deeper Challenges:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fund Shortages:</strong> States often face delays in central fund releases, impacting timely wage payments. This has led to protests, as seen in recent X discussions.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Wages:</strong> In some states, MGNREGA wages (e.g., ₹230/day in Bihar) are below market rates, reducing participation.</li>
        <li><strong>Administrative Gaps:</strong> Overburdened Gram Panchayats and untrained staff hinder effective planning and execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Exclusion:</strong> MGNREGA is rural-only, leaving urban poor without similar protections, sparking calls for an urban equivalent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RTI’s Role in Strengthening MGNREGA:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exposing Irregularities:</strong> RTI queries have uncovered fake job cards, inflated muster rolls, and diverted funds. For example, activists in Rajasthan used RTI to reveal ₹50 crore in misappropriated funds in 2023.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowering Workers:</strong> RTI enables workers to verify their wage credits and demand accountability. Training programs by NGOs often teach rural communities to file RTI requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Challenges with RTI:</strong> Some Public Information Officers delay responses or provide incomplete data, requiring appeals to Information Commissions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Socio-Economic Impact:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Migration Reduction:</strong> MGNREGA has slowed distress migration by providing local employment, especially during agricultural off-seasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Multiplier:</strong> Wages boost local economies, increasing demand for goods and services in rural markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Criticism:</strong> Some argue MGNREGA creates dependency or diverts labor from agriculture, though studies show it complements farm income.</li>
      </ul>

      

      <h3>How to Engage with MGNREGA:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apply:</strong> Register at your Gram Panchayat with ID proof. Work applications can be oral or written.</li>
        <li><strong>File RTI:</strong> To check MGNREGA records, submit an RTI application to the local PIO, specifying details like job card number or project name. Use RTI to track payments or report irregularities.</li>
        <li><strong>Participate in Social Audits:</strong> Join community audits to verify work and expenditure.</li>
      </ul>
