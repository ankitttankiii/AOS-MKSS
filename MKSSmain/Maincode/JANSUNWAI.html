    <p class="paragraph">Jansunwai, officially known as the Integrated Grievance Redressal System (IGRS), is an online portal and mobile application launched by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government to facilitate the registration, tracking, and resolution of citizen grievances related to government services and departments.

    <p class="paragraph">To provide a centralized, accessible platform for UP residents to lodge complaints, seek information, or raise demands about government schemes, public issues, or administrative inefficiencies, ensuring timely redressal and reducing corruption.</p>

    <h2>Meaning of the Term:</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">“Jansunwai” translates to “public hearing” in Hindi, reflecting its goal of listening to citizens’ concerns directly, akin to a virtual public forum.</p>
